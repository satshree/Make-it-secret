## Electron-React-Python
These underlying engines are what powers this app.  
1. Electron: The Electron library from GitHub is what provides a desktop platform for this app to work.  
2. React: The frontend UI of the app is built in React.  
3. Python: Every developer's favorite (well, mostly), the main encryption and decryption process is handled by Python.
